# Live-Migration-Algorithms

This word file discusses various algorithms used in live migration of Virtual Machines (VMs) in cloud environments, focusing on methods that ensure the availability and performance of VMs are not compromised during migration. Specifically, the algorithms covered are Pre-Copy Migration, Burstable VMs, and Stateful Live Migration. These techniques aim to migrate VMs between hosts without interrupting services or negatively impacting the availability of the VMs.

# Conclusion
In cloud environments, live VM migration is an essential operation to ensure high availability and resource optimization. The algorithms discussed—Pre-Copy Migration, Burstable VMs, and Stateful Live Migration—are effective in different scenarios based on the workload and migration requirements. These algorithms aim to:

Minimize VM downtime,
Optimize resource usage during migration,
Ensure the integrity and continuity of services during migration.
Each algorithm can be used individually or combined based on the cloud infrastructure and the needs of the application being hosted.
